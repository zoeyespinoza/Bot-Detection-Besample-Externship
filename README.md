# BotDetection
Bot Detection for Accurate Survey Results
## 
Besample is created to help researchers who work in both industry and academia to easily study diverse people from across the globe. they aim to enhance the reliability and accuracy of its survey results. Given the prevalence of automated bots that can skew data integrity, it is essential to identify and filter out these non-human participants. The presence of bots not only affects the authenticity of the survey data but also compromises the quality of insights derived from the research. Consequently, BeSample is committed to employing machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate the impact of bots on their surveys.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can efficiently identify bots within the user base. 
By achieving this, BeSample aims to:

**Enhance Data Integrity:** Ensure that survey results are exclusively derived from genuine respondents.

**Improve Survey Quality:** Increase the reliability of insights and decisions made based on survey data.

**Optimize Resource Allocation:** Reduce wasted resources on processing and analyzing responses.
